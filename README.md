# Health_Care_Chatbot_Project
To start a good life, healthcare is more important. Todays people are busy with
theirworks at home, office works and more addicted to Internet. They are not concerned
about their health. So they avoid to go hospitals for small problems. It may become a
major problem. So we create a aayush arogya chatbot using machine learning that can
find the disease before consulting a doctor. 
The chatbot provides text you can communicate with bot like user friendly. The
chatbot will clarify the users symptoms by asking questions, here symptom confirmation
will be done.Bot will provides which type of disease you have based on user symptoms.
The diseasewill be categorized as minor and major disease. 
Chatbot will reply whether it is a major or minor disease. For major disease it
appeared consult doctor and for minor disease it provides precautions like food
suggestion that means which type of food you have to take, yogic
exercises and mudras details. Aayush arogya chatbot reduce the healthcare cost and time
of the users as it is not possible for the users to visit the doctors or experts when
immediately needed.
Mainly by using N-gram algorithm, Term frequencyâ€“inverse data frequency (TFIDF)and Cosine similarity algorithms we are implementing aayush arogya chatbot.
